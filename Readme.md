# FixMatch Implementation Pytorch

## Overview

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of **FixMatch**, a semi-supervised learning algorithm that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to improve model performance. FixMatch combines consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve state-of-the-art results on image classification tasks.

## Features

- Clean and modular PyTorch codebase
- Support for various datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, etc.)
- Configurable training parameters
- Easy-to-use training and evaluation scripts

## Configuration

You can modify hyperparameters and settings in the `config.py` file.
